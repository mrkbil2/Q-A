      "Bangladesh,[a]officially thePeople's Republic of Bangladesh,[b]is a country inSouth Asia. It is theeighth-most populouscountry in the world and is among themost densely populated countrieswith a population of nearly 170 million in an area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi). Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the north, west, and east, andMyanmarto the southeast. To the south, it has a coastline along theBay of Bengal. It is narrowly separated fromBhutanandNepalby theSiliguri Corridor, and from China by the mountainous Indian state ofSikkimin the north.Dhaka, the capital andlargest city, is the nation's political, financial, and cultural centre.Chittagongis the second-largest city and is the busiest port on the Bay of Bengal. The official language of Bangladesh isBengaliwhileBangladeshi Englishis also used in the government and official documents alongside Bengali.\n",
      "Bangladesh forms the sovereign part of the historic andethnolinguisticregion ofBengal, which was divided during thePartition of Indiain 1947 as part of a Muslim union withPakistan, which it separated from in a bloody independence war in 1971.[21]The country has aBengali Muslimmajority. Ancient Bengal was known asGangaridaiand was a bastion of pre-Islamic kingdoms.Muslim conquestsafter 1204 heralded the sultanate andMughalperiods, during which an independentBengal Sultanateand a wealthyMughal Bengaltransformed the region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy. After theBattle of Plasseyin 1757, the maximum extent ofBritish Bengalstretched from theKhyber Passin the west to Singapore in the east.[22][23]The creation ofEastern Bengal and Assamin 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of Bangladesh. TheAll India Muslim Leaguewas founded in Dhaka in 1906.[24]In 1940, the firstPrime Minister of Bengal,A. K. Fazlul Huq, supported theLahore Resolution. Before thepartition of Bengal, aBengali sovereign statewas first proposed by premierH. S. Suhrawardy. Areferendumand the announcement of theRadcliffe Lineestablished the present-day territorial boundary.\n",
      "In 1947,East Bengalbecame the most populous province in theDominion of Pakistan. It was renamedEast Pakistan, and Dhaka became the country's legislative capital. TheBengali Language Movementin 1952; theEast Bengali legislative election, 1954; the1958 Pakistani coup d'état; thesix point movementof 1966; and the1970 Pakistani general electionresulted in the rise ofBengali nationalismandpro-democracymovements. The refusal of the Pakistanimilitary juntato transfer power to theAwami League, led bySheikh Mujibur Rahman, led to theBangladesh Liberation Warin 1971. TheMukti Bahini, aided by India, waged a successfularmed revolution. The conflict saw theBangladeshi genocideand the massacre of pro-independence Bengali civilians, primarily targetingintellectualsandHinduism. The new state of Bangladesh became the first constitutionallysecular statein South Asia in 1972, with a large Hindu minority.[25]Islamwas declared the state religion in 1988.[26][27][28]In 2010, theBangladesh Supreme Courtreaffirmed secular principles in the constitution.[29]\n",
      "Amiddle powerin theIndo-Pacific,[30]Bangladesh is home to thesixth-most spoken language in the world, thethird-largest Muslim-majority populationin the world, and thesecond-largest economyin South Asia. It maintains the third-largestmilitaryin the region and is the largest contributor of personnel toUN peacekeepingoperations.[31]Bangladesh is a unitaryparliamentary republicbased on theWestminster system.Bengalismake up almost 99% of the total population.[32]The country consists ofeight divisions,64 districtsand495 subdistricts, as well as theworld's largest mangrove forest. It hosts one of the largestrefugeepopulations in the world due to theRohingya genocide.[33]Bangladesh faces many challenges, particularlycorruption,political instability,overpopulationandeffects of climate change. Bangladesh has been a leader within theClimate Vulnerable Forum. It hosts the headquarters ofBay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation(BIMSTEC). It is a founding member of theSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation(SAARC), as well as a member of theOrganization of Islamic Cooperationand theCommonwealth of Nations.\n",
      "The etymology ofBangladesh(\"Bengali country\") can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such asNamo Namo Namo Bangladesh MomobyKazi Nazrul IslamandAaji Bangladesher HridoybyRabindranath Tagore, used the term.[34]Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies inEast Pakistan. The termBanglais a major name for both theBengalregion and theBengali language. The origins of the termBanglaare unclear, with theories pointing to aBronze Ageproto-Dravidiantribe,[35]and the Iron AgeVanga Kingdom.[36]The earliest known usage of the term is theNesari platein 805 AD. The termVangala Desais found in 11th-century South Indian records.[37][38]The term gained official status during theSultanate of Bengalin the 14th century.[39][40]Shamsuddin Ilyas Shahproclaimed himself as the first \"Shahof Bangala\" in 1342.[39]The wordBangālbecame the most common name for the region during the Islamic period.[41]16th-century historianAbu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarakmentions in hisAin-i-Akbarithat the addition of the suffix\"al\"came from the fact that the ancient rajahs of the land raised mounds of earth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were called \"al\".[42]This is also mentioned inGhulam Husain Salim'sRiyaz-us-Salatin.[43]The Indo-Aryan suffixDeshis derived from the Sanskrit worddeśha, which means \"land\" or \"country\". Hence, the nameBangladeshmeans \"Land of Bengal\" or \"Country of Bengal\".[38]\n",
      "Stone Agetools have been found in different parts of Bangladesh.[44]Remnants ofCopper Agesettlements date back 4,000 years. Ancient Bengal was settled byAustroasiatics,Tibeto-Burmans,DravidiansandIndo-Aryansin consecutive waves of migration.[45][46]Archaeological evidence confirms that by the second millennium BCE, rice-cultivating communities inhabited the region. By the 11th century, people lived in systemically aligned housing, buried their dead, and manufactured copper ornaments and black and red pottery.[47]TheGanges,BrahmaputraandMeghnarivers were natural arteries for communication and transportation,[47]and estuaries on the Bay of Bengal permitted maritime trade. The earlyIron Agesaw the development of metal weaponry, coinage, agriculture andirrigation.[47]Major urban settlements formed during the late Iron Age, in the mid-first millennium BCE,[48]when theNorthern Black Polished Wareculture developed.[49]In 1879,Alexander CunninghamidentifiedMahasthangarhas the capital of thePundra Kingdommentioned in theRigveda.[50][51]The oldest inscription in Bangladesh was found in Mahasthangarh and dates from the 3rd century BCE, written in theBrahmi script.[52]\n",
      "Greek and Romanrecords of the ancientGangaridaiKingdom, which (according to legend) deterred the invasion ofAlexander the Great, are linked to the fort city inWari-Bateshwar.[53][54]The site is also identified with the prosperous trading centre of Souanagoura listed onPtolemy's world map.[55]Roman geographers noted a large seaport in southeastern Bengal, corresponding to the present-dayChittagongregion.[56]\n",
      "AncientBuddhistandHindustates which ruled Bangladesh included theVanga,Samatataand Pundra kingdoms, the Mauryan andGupta Empires, theVarman dynasty,Shashanka's kingdom, theKhadgaandCandra dynasties, thePala Empire, theSena dynasty, theHarikelakingdom and theDeva dynasty. These states had well-developed currencies, banking, shipping, architecture, and art, and the ancient universities ofBikrampurandMainamatihosted scholars from other parts of Asia.Gopala Iwas the first ever elected ruler of the region in 750 AD; he went on to form the Pala dynasty that ruled until 1161 AD, during which time Bengal prospered.[57]Xuanzangof China was a noted scholar who resided at theSomapura Mahavihara(the largest monastery in ancient India), andAtisatravelled from Bengal toTibetto preach Buddhism. The earliest form of the Bengali language emerged during the eighth century. Seafarers in theBay of Bengalsailed and traded with Southeast Asia[58]and exported Buddhist and Hindu cultures to the region since the early Christian era.[59]\n",
      "The early history of Islam in Bengal is divided into two phases: the period of maritime trade with Arabia and Persia between the 8th and 12th centuries, and centuries of Muslim dynastic rule after the Islamic conquest of Bengal. The writings ofAl-Idrisi,Ibn Hawqal,Al-Masudi,Ibn KhordadbehandSulaimanrecord the maritime links between Arabia, Persia and Bengal.[60]Muslim trade with Bengal flourished after the fall of theSasanian Empireand the Arab takeover of Persian trade routes. Much of this trade occurred with southeastern Bengal in areas east of theMeghna River. There is speculation regarding the presence of a Muslim community in Bangladesh as early as 690 CE; this is based on the discovery of one of South Asia's oldest mosques in northern Bangladesh.[61][62][60]Bengal was possibly used as a transit route to China by the earliest Muslims.Abbasidcoins have been discovered in the archaeological ruins ofPaharpurandMainamati.[63]\n",
      "The Muslim conquest of Bengal began with the 1204Ghuridexpeditions led byMuhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji, who overran the Sena capital inGaudaand led thefirst Muslim army into Tibet.[47]Bengal was ruled by the Sultans of theDelhi Sultanatefor a century under theMamluk, Balban, andTughluq dynasties. In the 14th century, three city-states emerged in Bengal, includingSonargaonled byFakhruddin Mubarak Shah,Satgaonled byShamsuddin Ilyas ShahandLakhnautiled byAlauddin Ali Shah. These city-states were led by former governors who declared independence from Delhi. In 1352, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah united the three city-states into a single, unitary and independentBengal Sultanate. The new Sultan of Bengal forced the Sultan of Delhi toretreatduring an invasion. The army of Ilyas Shah reached as far asVaranasiin the northwest,Kathmanduin the north,Kamarupain the east, andOrissain the south. During the reign ofSikandar Shah, Delhi recognised Bengal's independence. The Bengal Sultanate established a network of mint towns that acted as provincial capitals where theSultan's currencywas minted.[64]As Bengal became the easternmost frontier of the Islamic world, Bengali crystallized as an official court language, giving rise to various prominent writers. The sultanate was evolving as a commercialized and monetized economy and as a melting pot of Muslim political, mercantile and military elites.[65]\n",
      "The two most prominent dynasties of the Bengal Sultanate were theIlyas ShahiandHussain Shahidynasties. The reign of SultanGhiyasuddin Azam Shahsaw the opening of diplomatic relations withMing China. The reign of the SultanJalaluddin Muhammad Shahsaw the development ofBengali architecture. During the early 15th century, Bengal aided theRestoration of Min Saw MoninArakan, which led to the latter becoming a tributary state of Bengal.[66][67]During the reign of SultanAlauddin Hussain Shah, Bengali forces penetrated deep into theBrahmaputra Valley, and conqueredpart of Assam,[68]Jajnagar in Orissa,[69][70]theJaunpur Sultanate,Pratapgarh Kingdomand the island ofChandradwip.[71][72][73][74][75]By 1500, Gaur became the sixth-most populous city in the world with a population of 200,000.[76][77]Maritime trade linked Bengal with China,Malacca,Sumatra,Brunei,Portuguese India, East Africa, Arabia, Persia, Mesopotamia,Yemenand theMaldives. The Sultans permitted the opening of thePortuguese settlement in Chittagong.\n",
      "The disintegration of the Bengal Sultanate began with the intervention of theSuri Empire.Baburbegan invading Bengal after creating the Mughal Empire. The Bengal Sultanate collapsed with the overthrow of theKarrani dynastyduring the reign of Akbar. However, theBhatiregion of eastern Bengal continued to be ruled by aristocrats of the former Bengal Sultanate led byIsa Khan. They formed an independent federation called theTwelve Bhuiyans, with their capital in Sonargaon. The Bhuiyans ultimately succumbed to the Mughals afterMusa Khanwas defeated.\n",
      "TheMughal Empirecontrolled Bengal by the 17th century.Musa Khan of Bengal, the last independent ruler ofSonargaonafter resisting Mughal conquest for several years on 10 July 1610 was defeated and dethroned byIslam Khan Chishti, the army general of Mughal EmperorJahangir. Islam Khan Chisty became the first MughalSubahdarof Bengal. After his defeat Musa Khan became loyal to the Mughal Empire. He actively participated in the conquest ofTripuraand the suppression of revolt inKamrup.[78]\n",
      "The Mughals established Dhaka as a fort city and commercial metropolis. It was the capital ofBengal Subahfor 75 years.[79]In 1666, the Mughals expelled theArakanesefrom the port of Chittagong. Mughal Bengal attracted foreign traders for itsmuslinand silk goods, and theArmenianswere a notable merchant community. A Portuguese settlement in Chittagong flourished in the southeast, and aDutch settlement in Rajshahiexisted in the north.[80]Bengal accounted for 40% of overall Dutch imports from Asia, including more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of raw silk.[81]The Bengal Subah, described as theParadise of the Nations,[82]was a major global exporter,[81][83][84]a notable centre of worldwide industries such asmuslin, cotton textiles, silk,[47]andshipbuilding.[85]Its citizens enjoyed one of the world's bestliving standards.[86]\n",
      "During the 18th century, theNawabs of Bengalbecame the region's de facto rulers, with a realm encompassing much ofeastern South Asia. The Nawabs forged alliances with European colonial companies, making the region relatively prosperous early in the century. Bengal accounted for 50% of the gross domestic product of the empire. The Bengali economy relied ontextile manufacturing, shipbuilding,saltpetreproduction, craftsmanship, and agricultural produce. Bengal was a major hub for international trade, renowned for its silk and cotton textiles worldwide.[87][47]Bengal was also famed as a shipbuilding hub.[88]\n",
      "Eastern Bengal was a thrivingmelting potwith strong trade and cultural networks. It was a relatively prosperous part of the subcontinent and the centre of the Muslim population in the eastern subcontinent.[89]TheBengali Muslimpopulation was a product of religious evolution,[47]and their pre-Islamic beliefs included elements of Buddhism and Hinduism. The construction of mosques, Islamic academies (madrasas), and Sufi monasteries (khanqahs) facilitated conversion, andIslamic cosmologyplayed a significant role in developing Bengali society. Scholars have theorised that Bengalis were attracted to Islam by its egalitarian social order, which contrasted with the Hindu caste system.[90]By the 15th century, Muslim poets were widely writing in theBengali language.Syncreticcults, such as theBaulmovement, emerged on the fringes ofBengali Muslimsociety. ThePersianateculture was significant inBengal, where cities like Sonargaon became the easternmost centres of Persian influence.[91][92]\n",
      "In 1756, nawabSiraj ud-Daulahsought to rein in the rising power of theBritish East India Companyby revoking their free trade rights and demanding the dismantling of their fortification in Calcutta. A military conflict culminated in theBattle of Plasseyon 23 June 1757.[93]Robert Cliveexploited rivalries within the nawab's family, bribingMir Jafar, the nawab's uncle and commander in chief, to ensure Siraj-ud-Daula's defeat.[94][95]Clive rewarded Mir Jafar by making him nawab in place of Siraj-ud-Daula, but henceforth the position was a figurehead appointed and controlled by the company.[96][97]Historians often describe the battle as \"the beginning of British colonial rule in South Asia\".[98]\n",
      "The Company replaced Mir Jafar with his son-in-law, Mir Kasim, in 1760. Mir Kasim challenged British control by allying with Mughal emperorShah Alam IIand the Nawab of Awadh, Shuja ud-Daulah, but the company decisively defeated the three at theBattle of Buxaron 23 October 1764.[95][97]The resulting treaty made the Mughal emperor a puppet of the British and gave the company the right to collect taxes (diwani) in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, giving them de facto control of the region.[97][99]The Company used Bengal's tax revenue to expand their territorial possession in rest of South Asia.[99]\n",
      "The Bengal Sultanate permitted thePortuguesesettlement in Chittagong to be established in 1528. It became the first European colonial enclave in Bengal. The Bengal Sultanate lost control of Chittagong in 1531 after Arakan declared independence and the established Kingdom of Mrauk U. Portuguese ships from Goa andMalaccabegan frequenting the port city in the 16th century. Thecartazsystem was introduced and required all ships in the area to purchase naval trading licenses from the Portuguese. Portuguese piracy in the sea flourished. The nearby island ofSandwipwas captured in 1602. In 1615, thePortuguese Navydefeated a joint fleet of theDutch East India Companyand the Arakanese near the coast ofChittagong.\n",
      "After 1534, the Bengal Sultan allowed the Portuguese to create several settlements atSatgaon,[100]Hoogly,Bandel, andDhaka. In 1535, the Portuguese allied with the Bengal Sultan and held the Teliagarhi pass 280 kilometres (170 mi) fromPatnahelping to avoid the invasion by the Mughals. By then several of the products came from Patna and the Portuguese send in traders, establishing a factory there in 1580.[101]The region accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia.[81]In 1666, the Mughal government of Bengal led by viceroyShaista Khanconquered Chittagong and expelled the Portuguese and Arakanese. The firstAnglo-Mughal Wartook place in 1686.[102][103]By the 18th century, the British,French, Dutch,DanishandAustrianEast India Companies built factories and trading posts across Bengal.[104][80][105][106]These companies obtained consent from theNawabs of Bengalfor trading rights and concessions. The British East India Company became the most powerful among the European companies in Bengal.\n",
      "After theBattle of Plasseyin 1757 andBattle of Buxarin 1764, by 1772 Bengal was the first major part of the Indian subcontinent to be conquered by theBritish East India Company. Under the terms of theTreaty of Allahabad, the company would collect taxes on behalf of the Mughal emperor. The treaty was written by the Bengali Muslim diplomatI'tisam-ud-Din.[107]UnderCompany rule in India, Bengal was effectively ruled by the British on behalf of the Mughal emperor under Mughalsuzerainty. The East India Company formed theBengal Presidency, through which it administered the region until 1858. A notable aspect of the company's rule was thePermanent Settlement, which established the feudalzamindarisystem; in addition, Company policies led to thedeindustrialisationof Bengal's textile industry.[108]The capital amassed by the East India Company in Bengal was invested in the emergingIndustrial RevolutioninGreat Britain.[109][110]Economic mismanagement, alongside drought and a smallpox epidemic, directly led to theGreat Bengal famine of 1770, which is estimated to have caused the deaths of millions of people.[111][112][113][114]Several rebellions broke out during the early 19th century, as Company rule had displaced the Muslim ruling class from power. A conservative Islamic cleric,Haji Shariatullah, sought to overthrow the British by propagating Islamic revivalism.[115]Several towns in Bangladesh participated in theIndian Rebellion of 1857.[116]\n",
      "After the 1857 rebellion, theBritish parliamenttransferred India's administration from the company to the British government. Direct rule by the Crown was imposed. The British government took over all the administrative functions of the Bengal Presidency.[117]\n",
      "At its maximum extent, the Bengal Presidency stretched from theKhyber Passto Southeast Asia. According to the British historianRosie Llewellyn-Jones, the Bengal Presidency was an administrative jurisdiction introduced by the East India Company and staffed by British civil servants, aristocrats and military officers. It would stretch across the whole of northern India up to the Khyber Pass on the north-west frontier with Afghanistan. It spread eastwards to Burma and Singapore.[118]The Bengal Presidency was arguably the largest division of theBritish Empire. Its territorial evolution can be contrasted with the maximum extent ofNew Spainin theSpanish Empire, which stretched from the Philippines to the Americas.[119][120]The Bengal Presidency originally covered the territory gained from theNawab of Bengalin theBattle of Plasseyin 1757, including the regions ofBengal,BiharandOrissa. It later stretched into areas of theNawab of Awadhand the Mughal capital in Delhi after theBattle of Buxarin 1764. TheSecond Anglo-Sikh Warresulted in the British conquest ofPunjab, and the eventual extension of the presidency to the Khyber Pass. TheBengal Armyplayed a key role in the expansion intoNorth Indiaup to the Khyber Pass. The nativeGurkhainfantry played a key role in the expansion of the presidency into the northeastern frontier regions ofAssam. The East India Company also took control of coastal Burma, while English traders brought trading settlements in theMalacca Straitsunder British rule.\n",
      "The rebellion of 1857 upended the government of British India. TheStraits Settlementswere separated from Bengal and became a crown colony in 1867.[121]By the turn of the century, most of northern India was reorganized into separate provinces, including Punjab, theUnited Provinces of Agra and Oudh, andAssam. In Burma, theArakanregion which bordered Bengal received many settlers. Wealthy farmers fromChittagongplayed an important role in developing the rice economy in Burma.Arakan Divisionwas one of the top rice exporters in the world, due in large part to rich farmers from Chittagong.[122][123][124]\n",
      "Within what is now Bangladesh, the trade networks of the British Empire brought traders and diplomats from far and wide.[125][126]Benjamin Joy was nominated byGeorge Washingtonas the first U.S. consul and a consular agency was created for Chittagong.[126]In Dhaka, the Mughal legacy was reflected the city's courtly-genteel manners based on Mughal etiquette. Dhaka became to communities ofArmenians, Greeks, andJews.[127]The British established several schools, colleges, and a university in what is now Bangladesh.Syed Ahmed KhanandRam Mohan Roypromoted modern andliberal educationin the subcontinent, inspiring theAligarh movement[128]and theBengal Renaissance.[129]During the late 19th century, novelists, social reformers, and feminists emerged from Muslim Bengali society. Electricity and municipal water systems were introduced in the 1890s;cinemasopened in many towns during the early 20th century. East Bengal'splantation economywas important to the British Empire, particularly itsjuteandtea. The British establishedtax-free river ports, such as thePort of Narayanganj, and large seaports like thePort of Chittagong.\n",
      "Bengal had the highest gross domestic product in British India, with the summer capital ofShillongboasting the highest per capita income in the subcontinent.[130]Bengal was one of the first regions in Asia to have a railway, which began operating in 1862.[131]The main railway companies in the region were theEastern Bengal RailwayandAssam Bengal Railway. Railways competed with waterborne transport to become one of the main means of transport.[132]\n",
      "Supported by the Muslim aristocracy, the British government created the province ofEastern Bengal and Assamin 1905; the new province received increased investment in education, transport, and industry.[133]However, thefirst partition of Bengalcreated an uproar inCalcuttaand theIndian National Congress. In response to growing Hindu nationalism, theAll India Muslim Leaguewas formed in Dhaka in 1906. The British government reorganised the provinces in 1912, reuniting East and West Bengal and makingAssama second province.\n",
      "The Raj was slow to allow self-rule in the colonial subcontinent. It established theBengal Legislative Councilin 1862, and the council's native Bengali representation increased during the early 20th century. TheBengal Provincial Muslim Leaguewas formed in 1913 to advocatecivil rightsfor Bengali Muslims. During the 1920s, the league was divided into factions supporting theKhilafat movementand favouring cooperation with the British to achieve self-rule. Segments of the Bengali elite supportedMustafa Kemal Atatürk'ssecularistforces.[134]In 1929, theAll Bengal Tenants Associationwas formed in the Bengal Legislative Council to counter the influence of the Hindu landed gentry, and theIndian IndependenceandPakistan Movementsstrengthened during the early 20th century. After theMorley-Minto Reformsand thediarchyera in thelegislatures of British India, the British government promisedlimited provincial autonomyin 1935. TheBengal Legislative Assembly, British India's largest legislature, was established in 1937.British Burmawas also separated from British India in 1937.\n",
      "Although, it won most seats in 1937, the Bengal Congress boycotted the legislature.A. K. Fazlul Huqof theKrishak Praja Partywas elected as the firstPrime Minister of Bengal. In 1940 Huq supported theLahore Resolution, which envisaged independent states in the subcontinent's northwestern and eastern Muslim-majority regions. Huq was succeeded byKhawaja Nazimuddin, who grappled with the effects of theBurma Campaign, theBengal famine of 1943which claimed the lives of millions of people,[135]and theQuit Indiamovement. DuringWorld War II, Bengal faced a possible Japanese invasion from Burma. Chittagong was bombed by the Japanese air force in April and May 1942.[136][137]Allied forceswere stationed across eastern Bengal during the war.[138]In 1946, the Bengal Provincial Muslim League won the provincial election with the largest Muslim League mandate in British India.H.

In 1950, theEast Bengal Legislative Assemblyenactedland reform, abolishing the Permanent Settlement and the zamindari system.[141]The 1952Bengali Language Movementwas the first sign of friction between the country's geographically separated wings. The Awami Muslim League was renamed the more secularAwami Leaguein 1953.[142]The first constituent assembly was dissolved in 1954. TheUnited Frontcoalition swept aside the Muslim League in a landslide victory in the1954 East Bengali legislative election.

Khan introduced a new constitution in 1962, replacing Pakistan's parliamentary system with a presidential and gubernatorial system (based onelectoral collegeselection) known as Basic Democracy.[143][144][145]In 1962, Dhaka became the seat of theNational Assembly of Pakistan, a move seen as appeasing increased Bengali nationalism.[146]The Pakistani government built the controversialKaptai Dam, displacing theChakma peoplefrom their indigenous homeland in theChittagong Hill Tracts.[147]TheIndo-Pakistani War of 1965blocked cross-border transport links with neighbouring India in what is described as a second partition.[148]In 1966, Awami League leaderSheikh Mujibur Rahmanannounced asix-point movementfor a federal parliamentary democracy.\n",
      "According to seniorWorld Bankofficials, the Pakistani government practised extensivelyeconomic discriminationagainst East Pakistan. Despite generating 70% of Pakistan's export revenue with jute and tea,[149]East Pakistan received much less government spending than West Pakistan. Economists in East Pakistan, includingRehman SobhanandNurul Islamamong others, demanded a separate foreign exchange account for the eastern wing. The economists paraphrased Pakistan'sTwo-Nation Theoryideology against India, by pointing to the existence of two different economies within Pakistan itself, dubbed the Two-Economies Theory.[150][151][152][153]The central government also refused to release foreign aid allocated for East Pakistan.[154]The populist leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested for treason in theAgartala Conspiracy Caseand was released during the1969 uprising in East Pakistanwhich resulted in Ayub Khan's resignation. GeneralYahya Khanassumed power, reintroducing martial law.\n",
      "Ethnic and linguistic discrimination was common in Pakistan's civil and military services, in which Bengalis were under-represented.[155]Cultural discrimination also prevailed, making East Pakistan forge a distinct political identity.[156]Authorities banned Bengali literature and music in state media.[157]Acyclonedevastated the coast of East Pakistan in 1970, killing an estimated 500,000 people,[158]and the central government was criticised for its poor response.[159]After the December 1970 elections, the Bengali-nationalist Awami League won 167 of 169 East Pakistani seats in the National Assembly. The League claimed the right to form a government and develop a new constitution but was strongly opposed by the Pakistani military and thePakistan Peoples Party(led byZulfikar Ali Bhutto).\n",

Bengalis continued to defect from Pakistan's diplomatic service, military, police, and bureaucracy. In April, they helped Awami League leaders to set up theProvisional Government of Bangladesh, which operated in exile fromCalcuttawith the support of the Indian government until December 1971. TheBangladesh Armed Forceswas formally established in November 1971, when Bengali forces secured control of much of the countryside.

With a joint ground advance by Bangladeshi and Indian forces, coupled with air strikes by both India and the small Bangladeshi air contingent, the capital Dhaka was liberated from Pakistani occupation in mid-December. During the last phase of the war, both the Soviet Union and the United States dispatched naval forces to the Bay of Bengal in a Cold War standoff. The nine-month-long war ended with thesurrender of the Pakistan Eastern Commandto the Bangladesh-India Allied Forces on 16 December 1971.[175][176]Under international pressure, Pakistan released Mujib from imprisonment on 8 January 1972 and he was flown to a million-strong homecoming in Dhaka.[177][178]Remaining Indian troops were withdrawn by 12 March 1972.[179]\n",

TheJamaat-e-Islamiformed paramilitary militias, which aided Pakistani troops and guided them to their intended targets. WhileBengali Muslimsbore the brunt of atrocities because of racial tensions with the largelyPunjabi MuslimWest Pakistani forces,[191]the minorityBengali Hinducommunity was singled out for attacks by the Pakistani armed forces, a legacy which has led Hindu nationalist groups to claim that the war was a Hindu genocide.[192]Archer Blood, the US Consul General in East Pakistan at the time of the war, described the situation as \"selective genocide\".[193][194][195]In 1974 and 2002, Pakistan formally expressed \"regret\" for what happened.[196][197]In 2015, Pakistan denied any atrocities took place.[198]In 2022, a bipartisan resolution was introduced in theUS Congressto \"Recognize the Bangladesh Genocide of 1971\".[199]TheInternational Association of Genocide Scholarsregards the atrocities as a genocide.[200][201]\n",

They expected to live in peace and harmony with all the nations in the world\".[205][206]He strengthened relations with India by signing a 25-year friendship treaty, a border demarcation agreement, and protocols on cross-border trade. The land boundary treaty was aimed at resolving border disputes inherited from East Pakistan and swapping theIndo-Bangladesh enclaves. The land boundary agreement was challenged in court, which ruled that the government needed the prior approval of parliament to implement the land boundary treaty.[207]Mujib was a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights despite Israel being one of the first countries to recognize Bangladesh's independence.

Most of the country is dominated by the fertileGanges Delta, the largest river delta in the world.[243]The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by theMadhupurand theBarindplateaus. The northeast and southeast are home toevergreenhill ranges.\n",
      "The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local namePadmaorPôdda),Brahmaputra(JamunaorJomuna), andMeghnarivers and their tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later join the Meghna, finally flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is called the \"Land of Rivers\";[244]as it is home to over 57trans-boundary rivers, the most of any nation-state. Water issues are hence politically complicated since the country is a lowerriparianstate to India.[245]\n",
      "Bangladesh is predominantly rich fertile flat land. Most of it is less than 12 m (39 ft) above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 m (3.3 ft).[246]17% of the country is covered by forests and 12% is covered by hill systems. The country'shaorwetlands are of significance to global environmental science. Thehighest point in Bangladeshis theSaka Haphong, located near the border with Myanmar, with an elevation of 1,064 m (3,491 ft).[247]Previously, eitherKeokradongorTazing Dongwere considered the highest.\n",
      "Straddling theTropic of Cancer, Bangladesh's climate is tropical, with a mild winter from October to March and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature below 0 °C (32 °F), with a record low of 1.1 °C (34.0 °F) in the northwest city ofDinajpuron 3 February 1905.[248]A warm and humidmonsoonseason lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such asfloods,tropical cyclones,tornadoes, andtidal boresoccur almost every year,[249]combined with the effects ofdeforestation,soil degradationanderosion. Thecyclonesof 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating, thelatterkilling approximately 140,000 people.[250]\n",
      "In September 1998, Bangladesh saw themost severe floodingin modern history, after which two-thirds of the country went underwater, along with a death toll of 1,000.[251]As a result of various international and national level initiatives in disaster risk reduction, the human toll and economic damage from floods and cyclones have come down over the years.[252]The2007 South Asian floodsravaged areas across the country, leaving five million people displaced, with a death toll around 500.[253]\n",
      "Bangladesh is recognised to be one of the countries mostvulnerable to climate change.[254][255]Over the course of a century, 508 cyclones have affected the Bay of Bengal region, 17 percent of which are believed to have made landfall in Bangladesh.[256]Natural hazardsthat come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as the climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health, and shelter.[257]It is estimated that by 2050, a three-foot rise in sea levels will inundate some 20 percent of the land and displace more than 30 million people.[258]To address thesea level risethreat in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 has been launched.[259][260]\n",
      "Bangladesh is located in theIndomalayan realm, and lies within four terrestrial ecoregions:Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests,Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests,Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests, andSundarbans mangroves.[261]Its ecology includes a long sea coastline, numerousrivers and tributaries, lakes,wetlands, evergreen forests, semi evergreen forests, hill forests, moistdeciduous forests, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass. The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertilealluvialsoil which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves ofmango,jackfruit,bamboo,betel nut,coconut, anddate palm.[262]The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering plants.[263]Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants.Water liliesandlotusesgrow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has50 wildlife sanctuaries.\n",
      "Bangladesh is home to much of theSundarbans, the world's largestmangrove forest, covering an area of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three protected sanctuaries–theSouth,East, andWestzones. The forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northeastern Sylhet region is home to haor wetlands, a unique ecosystem. It also includestropical and subtropical coniferous forests, afreshwater swamp forest, and mixed deciduous forests. The southeastern Chittagong region covers evergreen and semi-evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the plainland Sal forest running along with the districts of Gazipur,Tangail, andMymensingh.St. Martin's Islandis the onlycoral reefin the country.\n",
      "Bangladesh has an abundance ofwildlifein its forests, marshes, woodlands, and hills.[262]The vast majority of animals dwell within a habitat of 150,000 square kilometres (58,000 sq mi).[264]TheBengal tiger,clouded leopard,saltwater crocodile,black pantherandfishing catare among the chief predators in the Sundarbans.[265]Northern and eastern Bangladesh is home to theAsian elephant,hoolock gibbon,Asian black bearandoriental pied hornbill.[266]TheChitaldeer are widely seen in southwestern woodlands. Other animals include theblack giant squirrel,capped langur,Bengal fox,sambar deer,jungle cat,king cobra,wild boar,mongooses,pangolins,pythonsandwater monitors. Ba\n",

It is theeighth-most populouscountry in the world and is among themost densely populated countrieswith a population of nearly 170 million in an area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi). Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the north, west, and east, andMyanmarto the southeast. To the south, it has a coastline along theBay of Bengal. It is narrowly separated fromBhutanandNepalby theSiliguri Corridor, and from China by the mountainous Indian state ofSikkimin the north.Dhaka, the capital andlargest city, is the nation's political, financial, and cultural centre.Chittagongis the second-largest city and is the busiest port on the Bay of Bengal. The official language of Bangladesh isBengaliwhileBangladeshi Englishis also used in the government and official documents alongside Bengali.\n",
      "Bangladesh forms the sovereign part of the historic andethnolinguisticregion ofBengal, which was divided during thePartition of Indiain 1947 as part of a Muslim union withPakistan, which it separated from in a bloody independence war in 1971.[21]The country has aBengali Muslimmajority. Ancient Bengal was known asGangaridaiand was a bastion of pre-Islamic kingdoms.Muslim conquestsafter 1204 heralded the sultanate andMughalperiods, during which an independentBengal Sultanateand a wealthyMughal Bengaltransformed the region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy. After theBattle of Plasseyin 1757, the maximum extent ofBritish Bengalstretched from theKhyber Passin the west to Singapore in the east.[22][23]The creation ofEastern Bengal and Assamin 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of Bangladesh. TheAll India Muslim Leaguewas founded in Dhaka in 1906.[24]In 1940, the firstPrime Minister of Bengal,A. K. Fazlul Huq, supported theLahore Resolution. Before thepartition of Bengal, aBengali sovereign statewas first proposed by premierH. S. Suhrawardy. Areferendumand the announcement of theRadcliffe Lineestablished the present-day territorial boundary.\n",
      "In 1947,East Bengalbecame the most populous province in theDominion of Pakistan. It was renamedEast Pakistan, and Dhaka became the country's legislative capital. TheBengali Language Movementin 1952; theEast Bengali legislative election, 1954; the1958 Pakistani coup d'état; thesix point movementof 1966; and the1970 Pakistani general electionresulted in the rise ofBengali nationalismandpro-democracymovements. The refusal of the Pakistanimilitary juntato transfer power to theAwami League, led bySheikh Mujibur Rahman, led to theBangladesh Liberation Warin 1971. TheMukti Bahini, aided by India, waged a successfularmed revolution. The conflict saw theBangladeshi genocideand the massacre of pro-independence Bengali civilians, primarily targetingintellectualsandHinduism. The new state of Bangladesh became the first constitutionallysecular statein South Asia in 1972, with a large Hindu minority.[25]Islamwas declared the state religion in 1988.[26][27][28]In 2010, theBangladesh Supreme Courtreaffirmed secular principles in the constitution.[29]\n",
      "Amiddle powerin theIndo-Pacific,[30]Bangladesh is home to thesixth-most spoken language in the world, thethird-largest Muslim-majority populationin the world, and thesecond-largest economyin South Asia. It maintains the third-largestmilitaryin the region and is the largest contributor of personnel toUN peacekeepingoperations.[31]Bangladesh is a unitaryparliamentary republicbased on theWestminster system.Bengalismake up almost 99% of the total population.[32]The country consists ofeight divisions,64 districtsand495 subdistricts, as well as theworld's largest mangrove forest. It hosts one of the largestrefugeepopulations in the world due to theRohingya genocide.[33]Bangladesh faces many challenges, particularlycorruption,political instability,overpopulationandeffects of climate change. Bangladesh has been a leader within theClimate Vulnerable Forum. It hosts the headquarters ofBay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation(BIMSTEC). It is a founding member of theSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation(SAARC), as well as a member of theOrganization of Islamic Cooperationand theCommonwealth of Nations.\n",
      "The etymology ofBangladesh(\"Bengali country\") can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali patriotic songs, such asNamo Namo Namo Bangladesh MomobyKazi Nazrul IslamandAaji Bangladesher HridoybyRabindranath Tagore, used the term.[34]Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies inEast Pakistan. The termBanglais a major name for both theBengalregion and theBengali language. The origins of the termBanglaare unclear, with theories pointing to aBronze Ageproto-Dravidiantribe,[35]and the Iron AgeVanga Kingdom.[36]The earliest known usage of the term is theNesari platein 805 AD. The termVangala Desais found in 11th-century South Indian records.[37][38]The term gained official status during theSultanate of Bengalin the 14th century.[39][40]Shamsuddin Ilyas Shahproclaimed himself as the first \"Shahof Bangala\" in 1342.[39]The wordBangālbecame the most common name for the region during the Islamic period.[41]16th-century historianAbu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarakmentions in hisAin-i-Akbarithat the addition of the suffix\"al\"came from the fact that the ancient rajahs of the land raised mounds of earth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were called \"al\".[42]This is also mentioned inGhulam Husain Salim'sRiyaz-us-Salatin.[43]The Indo-Aryan suffixDeshis derived from the Sanskrit worddeśha, which means \"land\" or \"country\".

      "Stone Agetools have been found in different parts of Bangladesh.[44]Remnants ofCopper Agesettlements date back 4,000 years. Ancient Bengal was settled byAustroasiatics,Tibeto-Burmans,DravidiansandIndo-Aryansin consecutive waves of migration.[45][46]Archaeological evidence confirms that by the second millennium BCE, rice-cultivating communities inhabited the region. By the 11th century, people lived in systemically aligned housing, buried their dead, and manufactured copper ornaments and black and red pottery.[47]TheGanges,BrahmaputraandMeghnarivers were natural arteries for communication and transportation,[47]and estuaries on the Bay of Bengal permitted maritime trade. The earlyIron Agesaw the development of metal weaponry, coinage, agriculture andirrigation.[47]Major urban settlements formed during the late Iron Age, in the mid-first millennium BCE,[48]when theNorthern Black Polished Wareculture developed.[49]In 1879,Alexander CunninghamidentifiedMahasthangarhas the capital of thePundra Kingdommentioned in theRigveda.[50][51]The oldest inscription in Bangladesh was found in Mahasthangarh and dates from the 3rd century BCE, written in theBrahmi script.[52]\n",
      "Greek and Romanrecords of the ancientGangaridaiKingdom, which (according to legend) deterred the invasion ofAlexander the Great, are linked to the fort city inWari-Bateshwar.[53][54]The site is also identified with the prosperous trading centre of Souanagoura listed onPtolemy's world map.[55]Roman geographers noted a large seaport in southeastern Bengal, corresponding to the present-dayChittagongregion.[56]\n",
      "AncientBuddhistandHindustates which ruled Bangladesh included theVanga,Samatataand Pundra kingdoms, the Mauryan andGupta Empires, theVarman dynasty,Shashanka's kingdom, theKhadgaandCandra dynasties, thePala Empire, theSena dynasty, theHarikelakingdom and theDeva dynasty. These states had well-developed currencies, banking, shipping, architecture, and art, and the ancient universities ofBikrampurandMainamatihosted scholars from other parts of Asia.Gopala Iwas the first ever elected ruler of the region in 750 AD; he went on to form the Pala dynasty that ruled until 1161 AD, during which time Bengal prospered.[57]Xuanzangof China was a noted scholar who resided at theSomapura Mahavihara(the largest monastery in ancient India), andAtisatravelled from Bengal toTibetto preach Buddhism. The earliest form of the Bengali language emerged during the eighth century. Seafarers in theBay of Bengalsailed and traded with Southeast Asia[58]and exported Buddhist and Hindu cultures to the region since the early Christian era.[59]\n",
      "The early history of Islam in Bengal is divided into two phases: the period of maritime trade with Arabia and Persia between the 8th and 12th centuries, and centuries of Muslim dynastic rule after the Islamic conquest of Bengal. The writings ofAl-Idrisi,Ibn Hawqal,Al-Masudi,Ibn KhordadbehandSulaimanrecord the maritime links between Arabia, Persia and Bengal.[60]Muslim trade with Bengal flourished after the fall of theSasanian Empireand the Arab takeover of Persian trade routes. Much of this trade occurred with southeastern Bengal in areas east of theMeghna River. There is speculation regarding the presence of a Muslim community in Bangladesh as early as 690 CE; this is based on the discovery of one of South Asia's oldest mosques in northern Bangladesh.[61][62][60]Bengal was possibly used as a transit route to China by the earliest Muslims.Abbasidcoins have been discovered in the archaeological ruins ofPaharpurandMainamati.[63]\n",
      "The Muslim conquest of Bengal began with the 1204Ghuridexpeditions led byMuhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji, who overran the Sena capital inGaudaand led thefirst Muslim army into Tibet.[47]Bengal was ruled by the Sultans of theDelhi Sultanatefor a century under theMamluk, Balban, andTughluq dynasties. In the 14th century, three city-states emerged in Bengal, includingSonargaonled byFakhruddin Mubarak Shah,Satgaonled byShamsuddin Ilyas ShahandLakhnautiled byAlauddin Ali Shah. These city-states were led by former governors who declared independence from Delhi. In 1352, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah united the three city-states into a single, unitary and independentBengal Sultanate. The new Sultan of Bengal forced the Sultan of Delhi toretreatduring an invasion. The army of Ilyas Shah reached as far asVaranasiin the northwest,Kathmanduin the north,Kamarupain the east, andOrissain the south. During the reign ofSikandar Shah, Delhi recognised Bengal's independence. The Bengal Sultanate established a network of mint towns that acted as provincial capitals where theSultan's currencywas minted.[64]As Bengal became the easternmost frontier of the Islamic world, Bengali crystallized as an official court language, giving rise to various prominent writers. The sultanate was evolving as a commercialized and monetized economy and as a melting pot of Muslim political, mercantile and military elites.[65]\n",
      "The two most prominent dynasties of the Bengal Sultanate were theIlyas ShahiandHussain Shahidynasties. The reign of SultanGhiyasuddin Azam Shahsaw the opening of diplomatic relations withMing China. The reign of the SultanJalaluddin Muhammad Shahsaw the development ofBengali architecture. During the early 15th century, Bengal aided theRestoration of Min Saw MoninArakan, which led to the latter becoming a tributary state of Bengal.[66][67]During the reign of SultanAlauddin Hussain Shah, Bengali forces penetrated deep into theBrahmaputra Valley, and conqueredpart of Assam,[68]Jajnagar in Orissa,[69][70]theJaunpur Sultanate,Pratapgarh Kingdomand the island ofChandradwip.[71][72][73][74][75]By 1500, Gaur became the sixth-most populous city in the world with a population of 200,000.[76][77]Maritime trade linked Bengal with China,Malacca,Sumatra,Brunei,Portuguese India, East Africa, Arabia, Persia, Mesopotamia,Yemenand theMaldives. The Sultans permitted the opening of thePortuguese settlement in Chittagong.\n",
      "The disintegration of the Bengal Sultanate began with the intervention of theSuri Empire.Baburbegan invading Bengal after creating the Mughal Empire. The Bengal Sultanate collapsed with the overthrow of theKarrani dynastyduring the reign of Akbar. However, theBhatiregion of eastern Bengal continued to be ruled by aristocrats of the former Bengal Sultanate led byIsa Khan. They formed an independent federation called theTwelve Bhuiyans, with their capital in Sonargaon. The Bhuiyans ultimately succumbed to the Mughals afterMusa Khanwas defeated.\n",
      "TheMughal Empirecontrolled Bengal by the 17th century.Musa Khan of Bengal, the last independent ruler ofSonargaonafter resisting Mughal conquest for several years on 10 July 1610 was defeated and dethroned byIslam Khan Chishti, the army general of Mughal EmperorJahangir. Islam Khan Chisty became the first MughalSubahdarof Bengal. After his defeat Musa Khan became loyal to the Mughal Empire. He actively participated in the conquest ofTripuraand the suppression of revolt inKamrup.[78]\n",
      "The Mughals established Dhaka as a fort city and commercial metropolis. It was the capital ofBengal Subahfor 75 years.[79]In 1666, the Mughals expelled theArakanesefrom the port of Chittagong. Mughal Bengal attracted foreign traders for itsmuslinand silk goods, and theArmenianswere a notable merchant community. A Portuguese settlement in Chittagong flourished in the southeast, and aDutch settlement in Rajshahiexisted in the north.[80]Bengal accounted for 40% of overall Dutch imports from Asia, including more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of raw silk.[81]The Bengal Subah, described as theParadise of the Nations,[82]was a major global exporter,[81][83][84]a notable centre of worldwide industries such asmuslin, cotton textiles, silk,[47]andshipbuilding.[85]Its citizens enjoyed one of the world's bestliving standards.[86]\n",
      "During the 18th century, theNawabs of Bengalbecame the region's de facto rulers, with a realm encompassing much ofeastern South Asia. The Nawabs forged alliances with European colonial companies, making the region relatively prosperous early in the century. Bengal accounted for 50% of the gross domestic product of the empire. The Bengali economy relied ontextile manufacturing, shipbuilding,saltpetreproduction, craftsmanship, and agricultural produce. Bengal was a major hub for international trade, renowned for its silk and cotton textiles worldwide.[87][47]Bengal was also famed as a shipbuilding hub.[88]\n",
      "Eastern Bengal was a thrivingmelting potwith strong trade and cultural networks. It was a relatively prosperous part of the subcontinent and the centre of the Muslim population in the eastern subcontinent.[89]TheBengali Muslimpopulation was a product of religious evolution,[47]and their pre-Islamic beliefs included elements of Buddhism and Hinduism. The construction of mosques, Islamic academies (madrasas), and Sufi monasteries (khanqahs) facilitated conversion, andIslamic cosmologyplayed a significant role in developing Bengali society. Scholars have theorised that Bengalis were attracted to Islam by its egalitarian social order, which contrasted with the Hindu caste system.[90]By the 15th century, Muslim poets were widely writing in theBengali language.Syncreticcults, such as theBaulmovement, emerged on the fringes ofBengali Muslimsociety. ThePersianateculture was significant inBengal, where cities like Sonargaon became the easternmost centres of Persian influence.[91][92]\n",
      "In 1756, nawabSiraj ud-Daulahsought to rein in the rising power of theBritish East India Companyby revoking their free trade rights and demanding the dismantling of their fortification in Calcutta. A military conflict culminated in theBattle of Plasseyon 23 June 1757.[93]Robert Cliveexploited rivalries within the nawab's family, bribingMir Jafar, the nawab's uncle and commander in chief, to ensure Siraj-ud-Daula's defeat.[94][95]Clive rewarded Mir Jafar by making him nawab in place of Siraj-ud-Daula, but henceforth the position was a figurehead appointed and controlled by the company.[96][97]Historians often describe the battle as \"the beginning of British colonial rule in South Asia\".[98]\n",
      "The Company replaced Mir Jafar with his son-in-law, Mir Kasim, in 1760. Mir Kasim challenged British control by allying with Mughal emperorShah Alam IIand the Nawab of Awadh, Shuja ud-Daulah, but the company decisively defeated the three at theBattle of Buxaron 23 October 1764.[95][97]The resulting treaty made the Mughal emperor a puppet of the British and gave the company the right to collect taxes (diwani) in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, giving them de facto control of the region.[97][99]The Company used Bengal's tax revenue to expand their territorial possession in rest of South Asia.[99]\n",
      "The Bengal Sultanate permitted thePortuguesesettlement in Chittagong to be established in 1528. It became the first European colonial enclave in Bengal. The Bengal Sultanate lost control of Chittagong in 1531 after Arakan declared independence and the established Kingdom of Mrauk U. Portuguese ships from Goa andMalaccabegan frequenting the port city in the 16th century. Thecartazsystem was introduced and required all ships in the area to purchase naval trading licenses from the Portuguese. Portuguese piracy in the sea flourished. The nearby island ofSandwipwas captured in 1602. In 1615, thePortuguese Navydefeated a joint fleet of theDutch East India Companyand the Arakanese near the coast ofChittagong.\n",
      "After 1534, the Bengal Sultan allowed the Portuguese to create several settlements atSatgaon,[100]Hoogly,Bandel, andDhaka. In 1535, the Portuguese allied with the Bengal Sultan and held the Teliagarhi pass 280 kilometres (170 mi) fromPatnahelping to avoid the invasion by the Mughals. By then several of the products came from Patna and the Portuguese send in traders, establishing a factory there in 1580.[101]The region accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia.[81]In 1666, the Mughal government of Bengal led by viceroyShaista Khanconquered Chittagong and expelled the Portuguese and Arakanese. The firstAnglo-Mughal Wartook place in 1686.[102][103]By the 18th century, the British,French, Dutch,DanishandAustrianEast India Companies built factories and trading posts across Bengal.[104][80][105][106]These companies obtained consent from theNawabs of Bengalfor trading rights and concessions. The British East India Company became the most powerful among the European companies in Bengal.\n",
      "After theBattle of Plasseyin 1757 andBattle of Buxarin 1764, by 1772 Bengal was the first major part of the Indian subcontinent to be conquered by theBritish East India Company. Under the terms of theTreaty of Allahabad, the company would collect taxes on behalf of the Mughal emperor. The treaty was written by the Bengali Muslim diplomatI'tisam-ud-Din.[107]UnderCompany rule in India, Bengal was effectively ruled by the British on behalf of the Mughal emperor under Mughalsuzerainty. The East India Company formed theBengal Presidency, through which it administered the region until 1858. A notable aspect of the company's rule was thePermanent Settlement, which established the feudalzamindarisystem; in addition, Company policies led to thedeindustrialisationof Bengal's textile industry.[108]The capital amassed by the East India Company in Bengal was invested in the emergingIndustrial RevolutioninGreat Britain.[109][110]Economic mismanagement, alongside drought and a smallpox epidemic, directly led to theGreat Bengal famine of 1770, which is estimated to have caused the deaths of millions of people.[111][112][113][114]Several rebellions broke out during the early 19th century, as Company rule had displaced the Muslim ruling class from power. A conservative Islamic cleric,Haji Shariatullah, sought to overthrow the British by propagating Islamic revivalism.[115]Several towns in Bangladesh participated in theIndian Rebellion of 1857.[116]\n",
      "After the 1857 rebellion, theBritish parliamenttransferred India's administration from the company to the British government. Direct rule by the Crown was imposed. The British government took over all the administrative functions of the Bengal Presidency.[117]\n",
      "At its maximum extent, the Bengal Presidency stretched from theKhyber Passto Southeast Asia. According to the British historianRosie Llewellyn-Jones, the Bengal Presidency was an administrative jurisdiction introduced by the East India Company and staffed by British civil servants, aristocrats and military officers. It would stretch across the whole of northern India up to the Khyber Pass on the north-west frontier with Afghanistan. It spread eastwards to Burma and Singapore.[118]The Bengal Presidency was arguably the largest division of theBritish Empire. Its territorial evolution can be contrasted with the maximum extent ofNew Spainin theSpanish Empire, which stretched from the Philippines to the Americas.[119][120]The Bengal Presidency originally covered the territory gained from theNawab of Bengalin theBattle of Plasseyin 1757, including the regions ofBengal,BiharandOrissa. It later stretched into areas of theNawab of Awadhand the Mughal capital in Delhi after theBattle of Buxarin 1764. TheSecond Anglo-Sikh Warresulted in the British conquest ofPunjab, and the eventual extension of the presidency to the Khyber Pass. TheBengal Armyplayed a key role in the expansion intoNorth Indiaup to the Khyber Pass. The nativeGurkhainfantry played a key role in the expansion of the presidency into the northeastern frontier regions ofAssam. The East India Company also took control of coastal Burma, while English traders brought trading settlements in theMalacca Straitsunder British rule.\n",
      "The rebellion of 1857 upended the government of British India. TheStraits Settlementswere separated from Bengal and became a crown colony in 1867.[121]By the turn of the century, most of northern India was reorganized into separate provinces, including Punjab, theUnited Provinces of Agra and Oudh, andAssam. In Burma, theArakanregion which bordered Bengal received many settlers. Wealthy farmers fromChittagongplayed an important role in developing the rice economy in Burma.Arakan Divisionwas one of the top rice exporters in the world, due in large part to rich farmers from Chittagong.[122][123][124]\n",
      "Within what is now Bangladesh, the trade networks of the British Empire brought traders and diplomats from far and wide.[125][126]Benjamin Joy was nominated byGeorge Washingtonas the first U.S. consul and a consular agency was created for Chittagong.[126]In Dhaka, the Mughal legacy was reflected the city's courtly-genteel manners based on Mughal etiquette. Dhaka became to communities ofArmenians, Greeks, andJews.[127]The British established several schools, colleges, and a university in what is now Bangladesh.Syed Ahmed KhanandRam Mohan Roypromoted modern andliberal educationin the subcontinent, inspiring theAligarh movement[128]and theBengal Renaissance.[129]During the late 19th century, novelists, social reformers, and feminists emerged from Muslim Bengali society. Electricity and municipal water systems were introduced in the 1890s;cinemasopened in many towns during the early 20th century. East Bengal'splantation economywas important to the British Empire, particularly itsjuteandtea. The British establishedtax-free river ports, such as thePort of Narayanganj, and large seaports like thePort of Chittagong.\n",
      "Bengal had the highest gross domestic product in British India, with the summer capital ofShillongboasting the highest per capita income in the subcontinent.[130]Bengal was one of the first regions in Asia to have a railway, which began operating in 1862.[131]The main railway companies in the region were theEastern Bengal RailwayandAssam Bengal Railway.

The British government reorganised the provinces in 1912, reuniting East and West Bengal and makingAssama second province.\n",
      "The Raj was slow to allow self-rule in the colonial subcontinent. It established theBengal Legislative Councilin 1862, and the council's native Bengali representation increased during the early 20th century. TheBengal Provincial Muslim Leaguewas formed in 1913 to advocatecivil rightsfor Bengali Muslims. During the 1920s, the league was divided into factions supporting theKhilafat movementand favouring cooperation with the British to achieve self-rule. Segments of the Bengali elite supportedMustafa Kemal Atatürk'ssecularistforces.[134]In 1929, theAll Bengal Tenants Associationwas formed in the Bengal Legislative Council to counter the influence of the Hindu landed gentry, and theIndian IndependenceandPakistan Movementsstrengthened during the early 20th century. After theMorley-Minto Reformsand thediarchyera in thelegislatures of British India, the British government promisedlimited provincial autonomyin 1935.

In 1974, the government invited international oil companies to explore theBay of Bengalfor oil and natural gas.Petrobanglawas established as the national oil and gas corporation.[209]The Mujib government faced huge economic problems exacerbated by the resettlement of millions of people displaced in 1971, a breakdown in the food supply chain, poor health services and a lack of other necessities. The effects of the 1970 cyclone were still being felt, and theeconomyneeded reconstruction after the war.[210]TheBangladesh famine of 1974damaged Mujib's popularity.\n",
      "Mujib presided over a regime that was built around his personality cult. Sycophants and loyalists developed an ideology calledMujibism.\n",
      "In January 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman introducedone-party socialist ruleunderBAKSAL. Rahman banned all newspapers except four state-owned publications and amended the constitution to increase his power. He wasassassinatedduring a coup on 15 August 1975, and the presidency passed to theusurperKhondaker Mostaq Ahmadfor four months. Ahmad is widely regarded as a traitor by Bangladeshis.[211]Tajuddin Ahmad, the nation's first prime minister, and four other independence leaders were assassinated on 4 November 1975. Chief JusticeAbu Sadat Mohammad Sayemwas installed as president by the military on 6 November 1975. Bangladesh was governed by amilitary juntaled by theChief Martial Law Administratorfor three years. In 1977, the army chiefZiaur Rahmanbecame president. Rahman reinstatedmultipartypolitics,privatisedindustries and newspapers, re-opened theDhaka Stock Exchange, establishedBEPZAand held the country's second general election in 1979. In 1978, 200,000ArakaneseMuslim refugees crossed theNaf Riverinto Bangladesh due to a Burmese military crackdown. The refugees were later repatriated.[212]Asemi-presidentialsystem evolved, with theBangladesh Nationalist Party(BNP) governing until 1982. Rahman was assassinated in 1981 and was succeeded by vice-presidentAbdus Sattar.[213]\n",
      "After a year in office, Sattar was overthrown in the1982 Bangladesh coup d'état. Chief JusticeA. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhurywas installed as president, but army chiefHussain Muhammad Ershadbecame the country'sde factoleader and assumed the presidency in 1983. Ershad lifted martial law in 1986. He governed with four successive prime ministers (Ataur Rahman Khan,Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury,Moudud AhmedandKazi Zafar Ahmed) and a parliament dominated by hisJatiyo Party. Ershad pursued administrative decentralisation, dividing the country into 64 districts, and pushed Parliament to make Islam the state religion in 1988.[214]TheFirst SAARC Summitwas held in Dhaka under Ershad in December 1985.[215]Bangladesh dispatched its first contingent ofUN peacekeepersin 1988.[208]In 1990, Bangladesh joined the US-led coalition to liberate Kuwait during theGulf War.[208][216]Amass uprisingforced Ershad to resign, and Chief JusticeShahabuddin Ahmedled the country's first caretaker government as part of the transition to parliamentary rule.[213]\n",
      "After the 1991 general election, the twelfth amendment to the constitution restored the parliamentary republic, andBegum Khaleda Ziabecame Bangladesh's first female prime minister. Zia, a former first lady, led a BNP government from 1990 to 1996. In 1991, her finance minister,Saifur Rahman, began a major programme to liberalise the Bangladeshi economy.[217]In addition to setting up theChittagong Stock Exchange; banking, pharmaceuticals, aviation, ceramics, steel, telecoms, and tertiary education were opened up for investments, resulting in increased market competition. In 1992, an estimated 250,000 refugees fromBurmatook shelter in Bangladesh due to the suppression of the Burmese pro-democracy movement; most of these refugees returned to Burma by 1993.[212]In 1994, Bangladesh provided the largest non-US contingent inOperation Uphold Democracy, a military intervention inHaiti.[218]\n",
      "In 1996, a year of political upheaval saw aboycotted February election, anattempted military coup, and mediation efforts producing acaretaker governmentto oversee elections. For three months,Muhammad Habibur Rahmanserved as the interim leader of the country. The Awami League returned to power in theJune electionafter 21 years. One of the first initiatives of Prime MinisterSheikh Hasinawas to repeal the deeply controversialIndemnity Ordinance, which protected her father's killers from prosecution. Hasina also signed theChittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, which ended an insurgency in the southeastern hill districts. She reached an agreement with India forsharing the water of the Ganges.[219]In 1997, Sheikh Hasina hosted South Africa's first post-apartheid presidentNelson Mandela,PLOchairmanYasser Arafat, and Turkish presidentSüleyman Demirelfor thesilver jubileecelebrations of Bangladesh's independence.[220][221]\n",
      "The economic reform momentum lost steam due to political instability, including frequenthartalsand strikes by the opposition. In 2001, the BNP returned to power on the back of promises to improve the economy. The second Zia administration saw higher economic growth, but security and political problems gripped the country between 2004 and 2006. A radical Islamist militant group, theJMB, carried out a series of terror attacks. At the end of the BNP's term in 2006, there was widespread political unrest. The Bangladeshi military urged PresidentIajuddin Ahmedto impose astate of emergencyand a caretaker government, led byFakhruddin Ahmed, was installed from January 2007 to December 2008 to implement reforms to the electoral system, judiciary, and bureaucracy.[217]The JMB leaders were arrested and later executed in March 2007.[222]\n",
      "After achieving a landslide victory in the2008 Bangladeshi general electionthe Awami League government returned to power, taking their oath on 6 January 2009, with Sheikh Hasina once again becoming the Prime Minister and bringing political stability and economic growth to the nation.[223]In 2010, theSupreme Courtreduced the scope for military interventions through legal loopholes and reaffirmedsecularprinciples in the constitution. The Awami League set up awar crimes tribunalto prosecute surviving Bengali Islamist collaborators of the 1971 atrocities.Human rights abusesincreased under Hasina and her administration, particularlyenforced disappearancesby theRapid Action Battalion, with the government being accused as increasingly authoritarian since returning to power in 2009.[224][225][226][227][228]The2014 electionsand2024 electionswere boycotted by the BNP-Jamaat alliance. The BNP and Jamaat have often engaged in violent protests to overthrow the government.[229][230]In 2017, Bangladesh experienced the largest influx of Arakanese refugees in its history. An estimated 700,000Rohingyarefugees took shelter inCox's Bazarafter a campaign ofethnic cleansinginRakhine State,Myanmar.[231]\n",
      "The nationalpoverty ratewent down from 80% in 1971 to 44.2% in 1991 to 12.9% in 2021.[232][233][234]Bangladeshi economistMuhammad Yunusand theGrameen Bank, which Yunus founded, were awarded theNobel Peace Prizefor pioneeringmicrofinanceand their efforts to eradicate poverty. Bangladesh has emerged as the second-largest economy in South Asia,[235][236]surpassing the per capita income levels of both India and Pakistan.[237][236]Since 2009, Bangladesh has launched a series of infrastructure megaprojects. On 25 June 2022, thePadma Bridgeopened and connected southwestern Bangladesh with the rest of the country, while theDhaka Metrowas opened in 2023.[238][239]As part of thegreen transition, Bangladesh's industrial sector emerged as a leader in building green factories, with the country having the largest number of certified green factories in the world in 2023.[240]In January 2024, Awami League led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina secured a fourth straight term in Bangladesh'sgeneral election,  theJatiya Partywas the main opposition party.[241]In March 2024 the government vowed to keep the country's pace of rapid development ongoing.[242]\n",
      "Bangladesh is in South Asia on theBay of Bengal. It is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring India, and shares a small border withMyanmarto its southeast, though it lies very close toNepal,Bhutan, and China. The country is divided into three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertileGanges Delta, the largest river delta in the world.[243]The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by theMadhupurand theBarindplateaus. The northeast and southeast are home toevergreenhill ranges.\n",
      "The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local namePadmaorPôdda),Brahmaputra(JamunaorJomuna), andMeghnarivers and their tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later join the Meghna, finally flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is called the \"Land of Rivers\";[244]as it is home to over 57trans-boundary rivers, the most of any nation-state. Water issues are hence politically complicated since the country is a lowerriparianstate to India.[245]\n",
      "Bangladesh is predominantly rich fertile flat land. Most of it is less than 12 m (39 ft) above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 m (3.3 ft).[246]17% of the country is covered by forests and 12% is covered by hill systems. The country'shaorwetlands are of significance to global environmental science. Thehighest point in Bangladeshis theSaka Haphong, located near the border with Myanmar, with an elevation of 1,064 m (3,491 ft).[247]Previously, eitherKeokradongorTazing Dongwere considered the highest.\n",
      "Straddling theTropic of Cancer, Bangladesh's climate is tropical, with a mild winter from October to March and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature below 0 °C (32 °F), with a record low of 1.1 °C (34.0 °F) in the northwest city ofDinajpuron 3 February 1905.[248]A warm and humidmonsoonseason lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such asfloods,tropical cyclones,tornadoes, andtidal boresoccur almost every year,[249]combined with the effects ofdeforestation,soil degradationanderosion. Thecyclonesof 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating, thelatterkilling approximately 140,000 people.[250]\n",
      "In September 1998, Bangladesh saw themost severe floodingin modern history, after which two-thirds of the country went underwater, along with a death toll of 1,000.[251]As a result of various international and national level initiatives in disaster risk reduction, the human toll and economic damage from floods and cyclones have come down over the years.[252]The2007 South Asian floodsravaged areas across the country, leaving five million people displaced, with a death toll around 500.[253]\n",
      "Bangladesh is recognised to be one of the countries mostvulnerable to climate change.[254][255]Over the course of a century, 508 cyclones have affected the Bay of Bengal region, 17 percent of which are believed to have made landfall in Bangladesh.[256]Natural hazardsthat come from increased rainfall, rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as the climate changes, each seriously affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health, and shelter.[257]It is estimated that by 2050, a three-foot rise in sea levels will inundate some 20 percent of the land and displace more than 30 million people.[258]To address thesea level risethreat in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 has been launched.[259][260]\n",
      "Bangladesh is located in theIndomalayan realm, and lies within four terrestrial ecoregions:Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests,Mizoram–Manipur–Kachin rain forests,Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests, andSundarbans mangroves.[261]Its ecology includes a long sea coastline, numerousrivers and tributaries, lakes,wetlands, evergreen forests, semi evergreen forests, hill forests, moistdeciduous forests, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass. The Bangladesh Plain is famous for its fertilealluvialsoil which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves ofmango,jackfruit,bamboo,betel nut,coconut, anddate palm.[262]The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering plants.[263]Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants.Water liliesandlotusesgrow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has50 wildlife sanctuaries.\n",
      "Bangladesh is home to much of theSundarbans, the world's largestmangrove forest, covering an area of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three protected sanctuaries–theSouth,East, andWestzones. The forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northeastern Sylhet region is home to haor wetlands, a unique ecosystem. It also includestropical and subtropical coniferous forests, afreshwater swamp forest, and mixed deciduous forests. The southeastern Chittagong region covers evergreen and semi-evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the plainland Sal forest running along with the districts of Gazipur,Tangail, andMymensingh.St. Martin's Islandis the onlycoral reefin the country.\n",
      "Bangladesh has an abundance ofwildlifein its forests, marshes, woodlands, and hills.[262]The vast majority of animals dwell within a habitat of 150,000 square kilometres (58,000 sq mi).[264]TheBengal tiger,clouded leopard,saltwater crocodile,black pantherandfishing catare among the chief predators in the Sundarbans.[265]Northern and eastern Bangladesh is home to theAsian elephant,hoolock gibbon,Asian black bearandoriental pied hornbill.[266]TheChitaldeer are widely seen in southwestern woodlands.
